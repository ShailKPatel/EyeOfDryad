# VeriFI.AI – Verify Faces, Images, and Signatures with AI

**VeriFI.AI** is a multi-module AI system designed to detect visual forgery and deepfake content. It leverages deep learning to verify the authenticity of human faces, signatures, and digitally manipulated images. Built with PyTorch and Flask, VeriFI.AI serves as a powerful tool for applications such as identity verification, recruitment, journalism, and digital forensics.

## Capabilities

### 1. Fake Face Detection (F)
Classifies whether a given face is real or generated by AI systems (such as GANs).

Use cases include:
- Verifying profile photos in HR and KYC pipelines
- Detecting deepfakes in news and media
- Social media fraud prevention

### 2. Image Manipulation Detection (I)
Detects if an image has been altered using tools like Photoshop or GIMP.

Key features:
- Identifies tampered, spliced, cloned, or erased regions
- Useful for document validation (certificates, IDs, legal photos)

### 3. Signature Forgery Detection (A)
Classifies scanned signatures as genuine or forged using handwriting verification techniques.

Applications include:
- Banking and financial contracts
- Legal documents and academic records

### Model 2: Image Manipulation Detection
- Datasets used:  
  - CASIA v2.0  
  - NIST Nimble (TIDE)
- Goal: Detect copy-move, cloning, splicing, and erasure in images

### Model 3: Signature Forgery Detection
- Datasets used:  
  - CEDAR Signature Dataset  
  - GPDS 1-150 subset
- Goal: Binary classification of signature authenticity

## Sample Use Workflow

Upload any of the following:
- A facial photo: to check if it's AI-generated or real
- An ID document or edited photo: to detect tampering
- A scanned signature: to verify authenticity

Output includes:
- Authenticity label (Real or Fake)
- Confidence score
- Visual explanation using GradCAM or SHAP
